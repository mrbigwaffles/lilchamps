Highest Standards

Lil Champs nursery is situated in the heart of Preston. We are close to the city centre and serve the community in Deepdale and the surrounding areas. We provide a home from home environment for all our children.

 

Children are cared for by our experienced child care practitioners trained to the highest standards. The personal development, behaviour and welfare of the children are at the heart of our ethos.  Our practitioners create a stimulating learning environment where children under our care are taught through play.

    Qualified Staff with Years of Childcare Experience
    Spacious Environment for Your Child to Thrive
    Promoting social, emotional. physical and cognitive development
    We are community focused. We want to benefit the local Deepdale community with outstanding nursery services.

Our History

Savannah and Barkha (the founders) have been friends for many years. Their daughters went to the same school in Preston. They were both looking to start a venture together and what could be more appropriate than starting an educational setting in the very heart of Preston. 

 

They were both committed to helping out at the primary school’s PTA group where they gained immense knowledge on how to manage a childcare setting. Barkha was managing another nursery in Ribbleton for over twelve years and Savannah has a legal management background.

 

In 2015 they rented a dilapidated old and out of use health centre behind Noor Mosque and Home Bargains.  The building was renovated and the Ofsted registration was acquired after hard start up work.  We are Ofsted rated “Good” in 2017.  The doors were formally opened in January 2016 to serve and provide quality child care to the community.

Nursery children under our care have their own outdoor play area which includes tricycling/scootering, play house and den area. We also have a construction and water play area for the children to explore.  We are very fortunate to have access to the community allotment.

We have our own fruit and vegetable growing raised beds where children can plant their own strawberries and sunflowers. In the summer term we have built a bug hotel for the children. We are very keen for the children to explore nature and learn by playing outdoors (subject to weather conditions). We are also implementing forest school for our pre-school children.  Children travel to the nearby “Woodland Forest School” based in Fulwood and are engaged in various structured activities ranging from wood carving to treasure hunt.

At Lil Champs Nursery we like to think that we are very special as we serve a multicultural community with respect and kindness as our key motto. Every child is treated as individual and a tailored educational program is created for them. Each child thrives within our setting and they are prepared for their next step in starting primary school.

Your child’s health and safety are our top priority. Every child deserves the best possible start in life, with the opportunity to develop in an environment both safe and secure. Parents who use early years services, like our nursery, should be able to do so with the utmost confidence that their children will be getting the best possible experiences and are protected from harm at all times.  We abide by all government regulations to ensure your child is in a safe and secure environment.

A risk assessment is carried out daily before the children arrive to ensure that the nursery is safe for the children to explore and develop. 

Due to Covid-19, the windows are kept open for ventilation. Staff wear face shields as well as regularly cleaning the toys to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
the wonderful team.

FAQ
How will my child be helped in their development?

Each child develops at their own rate. We will be using the EYFS to track your child’s development. If they are behind on their development, we will plan individual activities with your child to help them develop in a certain area, for example: maths. 
Can I have flexible sessions?
How much are private fees?
Can I stay with my child?
Do you provide lunch?
